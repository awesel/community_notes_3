"A 9,000-year-old skeleton was discovered inside a cave in Cheddar, England, and was affectionately dubbed ""Cheddar Man."" DNA testing confirmed that a living relative lived approximately half a mile away, tracing their lineage back nearly 300 generations.  In 1903, while conducting excavations in Cheddar Gorge, Somerset, UK, researchers stumbled upon a remarkable find: the skeletal remains of a Homo sapien who had lived around 9,000 years ago. This individual ranks among the oldest modern humans ever found in Britain. The discovery occurred serendipitously during a drainage renovation within the tourist attraction of Gough's Cave.  Cheddar Man thrived during the Mesolithic period roughly 9,000 years ago. Most likely, he was a hunter-gatherer who passed away in his twenties and stood at a height of approximately 5 feet, 5 inches.  The use of cutting-edge technology has enabled researchers to reconstruct Cheddar Man's facial features, determine his skin and eye coloring, and even discern the texture of his hair. Genetic material extracted from one of Cheddar Man's molar teeth allowed scientists to identify Adrian Targett, a retired history teacher, as a relative.  Upon analysis, it was revealed that Targett's family lineage had endured in the Cheddar Gorge region for approximately nine millennia, with genes passed from mother to daughter through mitochondrial DNA, inherited from the egg.  In simple terms, Adrian Targett and Cheddar Man share a common maternal ancestor.",Tweet,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

"BREAKING: Shocking scandal rocks MAGA world as authorities arrest Fabian Marta — the man who funded the QAnon child trafficking movie ""Sound of Freedom"" that has been the toast of Republican circles for weeks now — for one of the worst crimes imaginable.  You won't believe this one...  Conservatives have been obsessed with Sound of Freedom, a movie that tells the lie-riddled but supposedly true story of a man chasing down pedophiles and international child traffickers.   The movie has struck a cord with deranged conservatives who believe that Democrats are all blood-drinking Satanic child molesters and has racked in $155 million so far.   Prominent Republicans and Fox News have praised the awful film for ""spreading awareness"" about child trafficking despite it being chock-full of fabrications.  The film was at least partially funded by a man named Fabian Marta. He bragged that he helped get the movie financed and made after Disney refused to release it.  Now, Marta has been outed as one of the villains from his own movie. According to the Missouri Courts website, he was arrested on July 21 for felony child kidnapping. He has also been accused of hosting predatory ""sugar baby"" events.  While the full details of Marta's child kidnapping case have yet to emerge, it certainly seems that his role in getting Sound of Freedom made was an act of profound psychological projection.  Isn't that always the case with Republicans? They accuse of others of doing what they themselves are guilty of.  This man must be locked up. Children are at risk.  Please retweet and  if you believe Marta belongs in prison — and consider joining the growing exodus to Tribel, a “woke” new Twitter competitor that banned Trump for life and is exploding in popularity because Elon Musk banned Tribel’s Twitter account — but he forgot to ban this link to download the new Tribel app: http://tribel.app.link/okwPIHYCIqb",Tweet,2,1,0,0,2,0,3,1,0,0

岸田首相の会見の最後で声を上げ、核軍縮ビジョンについて最前列から問いました。岸田氏は事前に決まっていた4社の質問に答えただけだったので、「事前に決まっていた4社以外にも答えて欲しい。核軍縮ビジョンについて質問させて下さい」と訴えましたが、それでも答えてくれず、「逃げるんですか」とさらに問いました。すると、岸田氏は戻ってきて回答。ただ、首相は核軍縮ビジョンについて、自分の宣伝したい見解を強調しただけでした。私はさらに「核を認める宣言がここで出てしまった、この広島でそんな宣言を出したのは大きな間違いだったのではないか」と問いましたが、首相はそのまま立ち去りました。  今回の核軍縮ビジョンには、米中露英仏の核5大国が昨年1月に出した「核兵器の防衛目的の役割、侵略の抑止、戦争の防止」の効果、をうたった声明と全く同じ英語の文言が盛り込まれ、核軍縮とは名ばかりで、実質は米国主導の核兵器容認声明になっています。  核廃絶のシンボルである広島で、核の抑止力や役割をうたった5大国の昨年1月の声明内容や論理がそのまま盛り込まれたのは、歴史に残る事態です。その点を、首相にきちんと質したかったのですが、首相は私の声かけには戻ってきたものの、マイクできちんと質問させてもらえず、首相は核軍縮ビジョンについての一方的な見解述べただけで終わってしまい、非常に残念でした。  官邸が事前にシナリオを決め、それを日本のプレスも外国プレスも容認しているのはあまりにもおかしいと思います。WHでの大統領会見などG7の首脳会見に私は何度も出てきましたが、日本の首相記者会見は、G7で最低だと感じます。  https://youtube.com/live/xfeVCc5Ludo?feature=share… Translate post,Tweet,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"""No piece of art has ever emotionally affected me the way this robot arm piece has. It's programmed to try to contain the hydraulic fluid that’s constantly leaking out and required to keep itself running...if too much escapes, it will die so it's desperately trying to pull it back to continue to fight for another day. Saddest part is they gave the robot the ability to do these 'happy dances' to spectators. When the project was first launched it danced around spending most of its time interacting with the crowd since it could quickly pull back the small spillage. Many years later... (as you see it now in the video) it looks tired and hopeless as there isn't enough time to dance anymore.. It now only has enough time to try to keep itself alive as the amount of leaked hydraulic fluid became unmanageable as the spill grew over time. Living its last days in a never-ending cycle between sustaining life and simultaneously bleeding out... (Figuratively and literally as its hydraulic fluid was purposefully made to look like it's actual blood). ""The robot arm finally ran out of hydraulic fluid in 2019, slowly came to a halt and died - And I am now tearing up over a friggin robot arm  It was programmed to live out this fate and no matter what it did or how hard it tried, there was no escaping it.  Spectators watched as it slowly bled out until the day that it ceased to move forever.  Saying that 'this resonates' doesn't even do it justice imo. Created by Sun Yuan & Peng Yu, they named the piece, 'Can't Help Myself'.  What a masterpiece. What a message."" Extended interpretations: the hydraulic fluid in relation to how we kill ourselves both mentally and physically for money just in an attempt to sustain life, how the system is set up for us to fail on purpose to essentially enslave us and to steal the best years of our lives to play the game that the richest people of the world have designed. How this robs us of our happiness, passion and our inner peace. How we are slowly drowning with more responsibilities, with more expected of us, less rewarding pay-offs and less free time to enjoy ourselves with as the years go by. How there's really no escaping the system and that we were destined at birth to follow a pretty specific path that was already laid out before us. How we can give and give and give and how easily we can be forgotten after we've gone.. How we are loved and respected when we are valuable, then one day we aren't any longer and we become a burden...and how our young, free-caring spirit gets stolen from us as we get churned out of the broken system that we are trapped inside of. Can also be seen to represent the human life cycle and the fact that none of us make it out of this world alive. But also can act as a reminder to allow yourself to heal, rest and love with all of your heart. That the endless chase for 'more' isn't necessary in finding your own inner happiness.” - James Kricked Parr Read More Articles: https://weirdium.com/donny-osmond-breaks-down-in-tears-during-brother-merrills-final-performance/… Join Now: Kindness, Humanity & Inspiration",Tweet,2,3,1,3,0,0,1,0,0,0

大事な記事です。  最近、ネトウヨと思われる皆さんから、「保険証の不正利用を放置するのか」とのコメントが数多く寄せられています。  もちろん、保険証の不正利用は犯罪（詐欺罪）であり、許されません。  しかし、彼らが、真剣に保険証の不正利用をなくしたいと思っているとは到底思えません。なぜなら、マイナ保険証のほうが“なりすまし”が容易になるからです。  先日、医療事務のスタッフにレクチャーを受け、患者さんがマイナ保険証で受診された場合の動きを確認しました。  患者さんは、本人確認の方法として、“顔認証”か“4桁の暗証番号入力”を選べます。 スタッフは、機会が正常に作動しているかは確認しますが、他の身分証明書を確認することはありません（そもそも、“一体化”が進めば、他の身分証明書はなくなっていきますね）。  つまり、4桁の暗証番号さえ知っていれば、簡単になりすましが可能だということです。  本当に不正利用をなくしたいのから、マイナ保険証には反対のはずですね。  そもそも、この騒ぎは、河野デジタル大臣が「それなりの被害」と言って煽ったことが始まりのようですが、被害の全体像については、厚労省も警察も把握していません。国民健康保険では、年間10件くらい…という話もありますが、かなりのレアケースです。私は25年医者をしていますが、そういう事例に出会ったことはありません。  記事で紹介されているように、現場での不断の努力の成果だと思います。 https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/071eea658dea75581eec3f4ca8e68968c86002dd?source=sns&dv=sp&mid=other&date=20230802&ctg=lif&bt=tw_up… Translate post Last edited,Tweet,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In 2014, three of those bugs escaped in high-profile escapes from different labs in the US. Congress held hearings on it. Everybody was angry, and 300 top scientists sent letters to Obama saying you got to shut down Fauci because he is going to create a pandemic.  So, Obama ordered a moratorium, and at that time, Fauci had eighteen different gain-of-function experiments he was doing around the US. He instead moved his stuff offshore to Wuhan, where he could do it out of sight of these 300 scientists and nosy White House officials who were trying to shut him down.

"There is no “conspiracy” in  (1) the vaccine being rushed  (2) there being serious adverse effects  (3) the efficacy being weak and waning at best   (4) the vaccine not having been tested on all cause mortality  (5) serious statistical worries that the efficacy has been overestimated due to systematic biases, like counting acquisition of Covid within three weeks of being vaxxed as “unvaccinated”  (6) the risks of Covid for anyone healthy being negligible, so why take the vax?  (7) that much of the population already had superior natural immunity prior to the existence of the vax  (8) that the state engaged in centralized censorship of voices skeptical of vaccine efficacy, need and all cause mortality   (9) that most who took the vax did so without informed consent, because they were not informed of the benefits and risks (see also censorship), and they were threatened with losing their job and being unable to participate in society if they didn’t take it  (10) that the unvaccinated were treated as less than human, and it was justifiable to do anything to them, from banishment to quarantine to denial of healthcare.

Presumably, if multiple family members went to get their COVID-19 vaccine at the same time, they may have received a “bad batch” or “hot lot”, a toxic pharmaceutical product with poor quality control that may have had too much mRNA or may have been contaminated with DNA plasmids containing the carcinogenic SV40 promoter!  The immune system damage and organ damage that those family members might then experience from a “bad vaccine batch” or a “hot lot”, may be similar and may give rise to turbo cancers in multiple family members.

"The Fed just announced it will introduce its “FedNow” Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in July. CBDCs grease the slippery slope to financial slavery and political tyranny.  While cash transactions are anonymous, a #CBDC will allow the government to surveil all our private financial affairs. The central bank will have the power to enforce dollar limits on our transactions restricting where you can send money, where you can spend it, and when money expires.  A CBDC tied to digital ID and social credit score will allow the government to freeze your assets or limit your spending to approved vendors if you fail to comply with arbitrary diktats, i.e. vaccine mandates.  The Fed will initially limit its CBDC to interbank transactions but we should not be blind to the obvious danger that this is the first step in banning and seizing bitcoin as the Treasury did with gold 90 years ago today in 1933.  Watch as governments, which never let a good crisis go to waste, use Covid-19 and the banking crisis to usher in a new wave of CBDCs as a safe haven from germ-laden paper currencies or as protection against bank runs.  https://cnbc.com/2023/03/15/long-awaited-fed-digital-payment-system-to-launch-in-july.html…",Tweet,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0

タイヤのトレッド面に刺さっている釘が原因でパンクした場合、「ほとんどが人為的である」とのことですが、さすがに言いすぎだと思います。例えば私は100%シャッター付きの車庫に入庫していますが、それでも釘が刺さることは、短期間ではありませんが、複数回ありました。  写真のようなワイドトレッドの車両の場合、刺さる確率はどうしても高くなります。工事現場の周囲には釘が落ちていることが多く、そういう場所を多く通行する車は、釘によるパンクが起こりやすいです。またワイドトレッドの車両で、不必要に路側に寄って走行・路上駐車の多い車も、パンクしやすい傾向があります。  参考  https://jaf.or.jp/common/news/2022/20220915-001,Note,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
人為的なパンクは、ほとんどが挿入抵抗の少なくかつ、アクセスの容易なサイドウォールへの異物貫通である。    トレッド面は相当ぶ厚いため、人の手で穴を開けるには垂直方向にかなりの力を入れて押す必要があるが、通常トレッド面はタイヤハウスに隠れており手が入らない。    トレッド面に異物が刺さるのは、前輪が引っ掛けて起こした突起物を後輪タイヤが踏み抜くケースである。起こされた異物の向きは不定だが、踏み抜く角度に起こされる確率はゼロではない。    私もこの理由でタイヤの後輪を、工事現場を通過した後にパンクさせた過去がある。    https://takuhai.gmtradings.co.jp/blog/cffe9b235cf  ,Note,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
